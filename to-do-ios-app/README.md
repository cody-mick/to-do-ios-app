# Overview

This is a simple ToDo app written in Swift for iOS devices. My main goal with creating the app was to educate myself on the iOS development environment as I have never used it before now. My main purpose of this app was to create a simple ToDo app, and although at this time it needs much more functionality, I am proud of what I was able to accomplish.
